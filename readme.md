# Self-hosted AMP runtime example

This repository includes AMP &amp; PWAMP examples of using a self-hosted AMP framework:

- [self-hosted-amprt-amp.html](https://ampdemo.cmphys.com/amp-sh/self-hosted-amprt-amp.html) - Standard AMP page
- [self-hosted-amprt-opt.html](https://ampdemo.cmphys.com/amp-sh/self-hosted-amprt-opt.html) - Optimized AMP page (no runtime version specified)
- [self-hosted-amprt-opt-rtv.html](https://ampdemo.cmphys.com/amp-sh/self-hosted-amprt-opt-rtv.html) - Optimized AMP page (runtime version specified)
- [self-hosted-amprt-pwa.html](https://ampdemo.cmphys.com/amp-sh/self-hosted-amprt-pwa.html) - PWA that supports loading any of the AMP pages

Support for this feature has recently been merged into [amphtml](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) and [amp-toolbox](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-toolbox) 2.1.0+.

A full guide is under review by the AMP Project. A snapshot of the current version is available in this repository: [Guide.md](./blob/master/guide.md).
